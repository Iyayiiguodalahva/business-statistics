README – Business Statistics Final Assignment (Group B)

**Project Overview**

This project was conducted as part of the Business Statistics course. The final assignment consisted of two sub-assignments, each requiring data analysis using statistical methods in Python. The objectives included exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and developing statistical models or clustering techniques where applicable.

**Dataset Selection**
	•	Sub-assignment 1: We chose the [RetailRocket] dataset from the two available options (Unfortunately, the dataset is too large to upload). 
	•	Sub-assignment 2: We used the Tao Yin dataset as it was compulsory.

**Research Questions and Objectives**
For both sub-assignments, we formulated research questions that guided our statistical analysis. These included:
	•	Identifying key trends and patterns in the dataset.
	•	Examining relationships between different variables.
	•	Testing hypotheses related to consumer behavior.
	•	Creating meaningful data-driven insights using clustering or predictive modeling.

**Data Analysis Process**
	1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Data cleaning, handling missing values, and checking data distributions.
	•	Visualizing data trends using histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
	•	Identifying outliers and anomalies.
	2.	Hypothesis Testing and Assumptions
	•	Conducted statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square tests) to validate hypotheses.
	•	Assessed assumptions for statistical models.
	3.	Feature Engineering & Clustering
	•	Applied one-hot encoding and normalization techniques.
	•	Implemented clustering methods (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) where applicable.
	4.	Statistical Modeling & Machine Learning
	•	Developed regression models and classification techniques based on dataset requirements.
	•	Evaluated models using accuracy metrics (e.g., RMSE, precision-recall, F1-score).
	5.	Results Interpretation & Visualization
	•	Generated insights from analysis using statistical reasoning.
	•	Presented findings with appropriate graphs and charts (bar plots, correlation matrices, etc.).

**Deliverables**
	•	Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): Includes Python code, analysis, and results.
	•	Video Presentation (.mp4): A 10-minute video where each group member explains their contribution.

Each team member contributed to different aspects of the project, including:
	•	Data preprocessing and cleaning.
	•	Writing and testing Python scripts.
	•	Statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
	•	Interpreting results and creating visualizations.
	•	Preparing the final presentation and report.
